      <description>Speaker Yuval Kirstain: During my PhD in generative AI under Professor Omer Levy, I specialized in natural language processing and text-to-image generation. My research has been devoted to developing solutions for acquiring and utilizing task-specific data without the need for traditional crowd workers, employing self-supervised training techniques and gamification instead. My practical experience includes two internships at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), focusing on text-to-image generation and editing. Prior to FAIR, I worked on end-to-end task-oriented dialogue during an internship at IBM Research and gained comprehensive experience in training and evaluating large language models while working at AI21 Labs.</description>

      <description>Speaker Shiori Sagawa is a fourth-year PhD student at Stanford University, advised by Percy Liang. She studies robustness to distribution shifts, and to this end, she has developed methods based on distributionally robust optimization, analyzed these algorithms in the context of deep learning models, and recently built a benchmark on distribution shifts in the wild. She is an Apple PhD Scholar in AI/ML.
Homepage: https://cs.stanford.edu/~ssagawa/.
Abstract Machine learning models deployed in the real world constantly face distribution shifts, yet current models are not robust to these shifts; they can perform well when the train and test distributions are identical, but still have their performance plummet when evaluated on a different test distribution.</description>

Abstract The mainstream paradigm behind continual learning has been to adapt the model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, where catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge. In this talk, we present a new continual learning paradigm – Prompting-based Continual Learning, which learns a tiny set of parameters, called prompts, to properly instruct a pre-trained model to learn tasks arriving sequentially.</description>

Abstract I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods for fine-tuning which improve model robustness and accuracy. These methods leverage the observation that fine-tuned models often appear to lie in a single low error region. To improve robustness, we therefore interpolate the weights of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models.</description>
