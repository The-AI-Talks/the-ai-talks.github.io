Abstract The mainstream paradigm behind continual learning has been to adapt the model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, where catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge. In this talk, we present a new continual learning paradigm – Prompting-based Continual Learning, which learns a tiny set of parameters, called prompts, to properly instruct a pre-trained model to learn tasks arriving sequentially.</description>

Abstract I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss methods for fine-tuning which improve model robustness and accuracy. These methods leverage the observation that fine-tuned models often appear to lie in a single low error region. To improve robustness, we therefore interpolate the weights of the pre-trained and fine-tuned models.</description>

Abstract We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits.</description>
