      <description>Speaker Xiaolong Wang is an Assistant Professor in the ECE department at the University of California, San Diego. He received his Ph.D. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. His postdoctoral training was at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on the intersection between computer vision and robotics. His specific interest lies in learning 3D and dynamics representations from videos and physical robotic interaction data. These comprehensive representations are utilized to facilitate the learning of robot skills, with the goal of generalizing the robot to interact effectively with a wide range of objects and environments in the real physical world.</description>
