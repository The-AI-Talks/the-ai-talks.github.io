      <description>Speaker Yiyi Liao is an assistant professor at Zhejiang University. Prior to that, she received her Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University and subsequently worked as a Postdoc in MPI for Intelligent Systems and the University of Tübingen. Her research interest lies in 3D computer vision, including 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image synthesis.
Abstract A high-fidelity simulation platform has significant value for the development of autonomous driving. Conventional simulation platforms, manually crafted, often deviate from reality and entail substantial costs.</description>
