  Abstract

</h1>
<p>The world is faced with an ageing population, which brings about increasing threat for accessibility and quality of medical services. Technological innovations are important to address the forthcoming challenges and hold unprecedented opportunities to transform the healthcare industry. Recent rapid advancements in AI and robotics have made the domain of medical applications highly interdisciplinary, where clinicians take advantages of computers, sensors and robots to perform medical diagnosis and interventions with more efficiency and precision.</p>
<p>AI CoPilot, together with its authorized cognitive assistance, intelligent data analytics, and automation, is envisaged to be an effective tool to facilitate clinical workflow in numerous known or unknown ways. In this talk, I will present our research and developments in medical image analysis and robotic surgical intelligence as a demonstration for one step forward such AI CoPilot in medical applications. My talk will cover novel methodologies for addressing technical challenges from medical data, as well as a few use cases with specific system integrations through long-term joint effort with clinical collaborators. I will also share experiences and pitfalls in conducting interdisciplinary research.</p>
