  Abstract
  <a class="heading-link" href="#abstract">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>In this presentation, we will cover three papers that explore methods for collecting and utilizing task-specific data without reliance on traditional crowd workers, with a focus on both natural language processing and text-to-image generation. The first two papers center on self-supervised training techniques. The first paper introduces a pretraining scheme called &ldquo;recurring span selection,&rdquo; enabling dramatic improvements in few-shot question answering. In the second paper, we present a self-supervised training approach for subject-driven text-to-image generation. By combining this approach with a new conditioning mechanism on images, we generate images that align with both user prompts and subject images without needing optimization during inference time. The third paper diverges by introducing a gamification method for collecting supervised task-specific data. This approach allows us to collect and open-source a large dataset for human preferences in text-to-image generation, leading to the creation of PickScore, a scoring function that exhibits superhuman performance in predicting human preferences.</p>
